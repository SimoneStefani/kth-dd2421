# Decision Trees


### 1. MONK Datasets
#### Assignment 0:
> Each one of the datasets has properties which makes them hard to learn. Motivate which of the three problems is most difficult for a decision tree algorithm to learn.

* Dataset 1
* Dataset 2 is hard to learn because the true concept behind it involves the value of an attribute in respect to the value of another attribute. Hence the space cannot be split based on the value of a single attribute.
* Dataset 3 contains a 5% noise in the training set
